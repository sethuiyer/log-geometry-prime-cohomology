## Overview

**Log-Geometry-Prime-Cohomology** presents a unified framework combining logarithmic geometry, analytic number theory, and higher category theory, centered on the introduction of nilpotent extensions. The repository contains the full research paper, conceptual scaffolding, and planned computational components that together enable:

* Logarithmic Čech cohomology complexes extended by nilpotent parameters.
* Prime-indexed cocycles reconstructing logarithmic components of the Riemann zeta function.
* Derived global section computations on Kato log schemes with enriched structures.
* Categorification via anti-commuting nilpotents, yielding explicit higher gerbes indexed by primes.

This work bridges several advanced fields and offers a foundation for further research across geometry, number theory, and higher categories.

## Background and Motivation

Logarithmic geometry provides a robust framework for studying degenerations and singularities in algebraic geometry. Yet, many obstruction phenomena remain implicit. This work introduces nilpotent extensions to make such obstructions explicit and computable through cohomology. The introduction of prime-indexed cocycles grounds these constructions in arithmetic, revealing deep ties to the analytic behavior of the Riemann zeta function.

This framework formalizes those connections, positioning them for further exploration in both theoretical and computational directions.

## Potential Applications

* **Analytic Number Theory**: Cohomological approaches to the zeta function, prime distributions, and zero-density estimates.
* **Algebraic Geometry**: New tools for studying log schemes, degenerations, and dualities in the presence of nilpotent structures.
* **Higher Category Theory**: Prime-indexed gerbes and explicit cocycle models for higher stacks and descent data.
* **Mathematical Physics**: Potential links to moduli problems, background fields, and logarithmic string-theoretic constructions.
